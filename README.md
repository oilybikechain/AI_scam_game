# ðŸŽ® Scam or Genuine? The AI-Powered Decision Game ðŸ¤–

Welcome to "Scam or Genuine?", an interactive SvelteKit game where you, the player, must discern truth from deception in everyday scenarios generated by cutting-edge AI!

This project serves as a practical demonstration of integrating a SvelteKit frontend with a SvelteKit backend API that, in turn, interacts with Google's Gemini AI Studio for dynamic content generation.

## âœ¨ Features

*   **AI-Generated Scenarios:** Each new game presents a unique, ambiguous scenario (e.g., a suspicious email, a tempting offer, a strange encounter) crafted by Google's Gemini AI.
*   **Decision Point:** A clear choice is presented within each scenario, forcing the player to consider if the situation is a scam or genuine.
*   **Instant Reveal & Explanation:** After generation, the game immediately reveals whether the AI deemed the scenario a scam or genuine, along with concrete points of evidence (red flags or legitimacy indicators) directly from the narrative.
*   **Two-Way Data Binding:** Seamless user input handling in Svelte.
*   **Backend API Proxy:** Securely calls the Google Gemini API from the server, keeping your API key protected.
*   **Modern Web Stack:** Built with SvelteKit, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript.
